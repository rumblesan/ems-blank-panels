# EMS Blank Tiles

EMS branded blank tiles, featuring our mascot Waffles.

The logo was originally created by Heckseven and Mother Dessicant, with potentially some other tweaks by people along the way.

## Description

Project also includes a KiCad footprint library with various bits, as well as an Inkscape project with some panel templates. All a bit messy and it'll get tidied up gradually.
